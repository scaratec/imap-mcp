# LIM NNNN: <Short Noun Phrase>

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Mitigated | Resolved | Superseded by [LIM-XXXX](XXXX-title.md)
- **Resolution intent:** must-resolve (technical debt) | permanent (architectural boundary)
- **Date proposed:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Date approved:** YYYY-MM-DD (required before Accepted)
- **Proposed by:** <name or agent id>
- **Approved by:** <project-owner name, required before Accepted>
- **Related ADRs:** [ADR-XXXX](../adr/XXXX-title.md), …
- **Related Guidelines:** BDD Guidelines §N.N, §N.N

## Resolution intent

Mandatory classification. Every limitation is one of two kinds:

- **`must-resolve`** — a technical debt that is accepted *now* but
  must be paid back. The record must list an explicit resolution plan
  (even if the timing is uncertain) and concrete paydown triggers in
  the "Triggers for revisit" section. A `must-resolve` record is
  tracked as an open debt item in the project's task list until its
  status becomes `Resolved`.
- **`permanent`** — an architectural or theoretical boundary that the
  project has decided to live with indefinitely. No resolution is
  expected. The record still lists "Triggers for revisit" so that
  future external advances (new tooling, new standards, changed
  threat model) can force a re-examination, but no paydown is owed.

"Not sure" is not a valid value. If the classification cannot be
argued convincingly for one of the two, the record is not ready for
approval.

## Context

Where in the system does this limitation arise? Which ADR or guideline
would dictate a different, cleaner outcome, and why can it not be
reached? Describe the terrain factually — the reviewer must be able to
understand the constraint without prior briefing.

## Nature of the weakness

State the limitation precisely. Not "the BDD suite is not perfect" —
say *exactly* which property is missing, under *which conditions*, and
with *which observable consequence*. Vague records are rejected at
review.

## Why the clean solution is not chosen

Justify the exception. Acceptable reasons include:

- A theoretical limit (BDD contract tests share vocabulary with the
  API under test; property-based tests on generated policies lie
  outside the BDD paradigm; etc.).
- A disproportionate cost vs. the residual risk, with numbers.
- An external dependency outside project control.
- An explicit scope boundary from a superseded ADR.

Unacceptable reasons: "it's hard", "we ran out of time", "the ADR is
too strict". Those lead to doing the work, not to a Limitation
Record.

## Mitigations in place

List every mitigation that reduces the residual risk. Each entry
should be concrete enough that a reviewer can verify it exists:

- Structural cross-check in scenarios (field X consistent with Y).
- Separate contract test (`path/to/feature.feature`).
- Property-based unit tests at `path/to/test.py`.
- Spec-audit checklist item.
- Runtime invariant enforced at module X.

Absence of mitigations is a red flag. A record with no mitigations is
effectively "we accept the problem as-is" and must argue explicitly why
no mitigation is possible.

## Residual risk

Describe, in concrete terms, the worst case that can still happen.
A good residual-risk statement reads like a bug report the author
would *expect* to see one day. Vague phrasings ("minor risk",
"limited exposure") are rejected.

## Triggers for revisit

Under which externally observable conditions must this record be
re-examined? Examples:

- If the spec audit produces ≥ N findings attributable to this
  limitation.
- If a new ADR changes the underlying architecture.
- If an external tooling advance removes the theoretical barrier.
- If an incident report links to this record.

"Never" is not a trigger. Every limitation must have at least one.
